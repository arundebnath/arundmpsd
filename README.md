# About me

I specialize in the physical modeling of quantum dynamics. In the past, my research work was able to describe a wide range of phenomenology involving laser-matter interactions, dissipative systems, and quantum spectroscopy. 


# Research

Over the past years, my research focussed broadly on developing novel theories for photon-matter interactions, often using field-theoretic techniques.
I have been particularly interested in understanding
- The nature of diffraction at high energies (typically taking place at x-ray free-electron laser sources) from a many-body perspective aimed at single particle imaging.
- The role of photonic entanglements (as used in multidimensional nonlinear optics) in the dynamics of complex systems interacting with localized photonic modes.
- The role of shaped pulses in controlled multidimensional spectroscopy.

# Passion

An ambitious plan for a start-up which leverages ML and quantum algorithms for providing precision imaging is in the offing.
