# About me

I am a quantum physicist. I specialize in the physical modelling of quantum dynamics and phenomenology involving laser-matter interactions.


# Research

Over the past years, my research focussed broadly on developing novel theories for photon-matter interactions, often using field-theoretic techniques. I have been particularly interested in understanding
- the nature of high-energy diffraction at x-ray free-electron laser sources from a many-body perspective aimed at single particle imaging.
- the role of photonic entanglement in multidimensional nonlinear optics for complex systems interacting with localized photonic modes.
- the role of shaped pulses in controlled multidimensional spectroscopy.

# Passion

An ambitious plan for a start-up which can leverages quantum information processing protocols for solving one specific bio-technological problem is in the offing.
