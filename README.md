# Hi, Arun here.\
Over the past years, my research focussed broadly on developing novel theories for photon-matter interactions, often using field-theoretic techniques. I have been particularly interested in understanding \
- the nature of high-energy diffraction at x-ray free-electron laser sources from a many-body perspective aimed at single particle imaging.\
- the role of photonic entanglement in multidimensional nonlinear optics for complex systems interacting with localized photonic modes.\
- the role of shaped pulses in controlled multidimensional spectroscopy.\

A plan for a start-up that leverages quantum information processing protocols is in the offing.
